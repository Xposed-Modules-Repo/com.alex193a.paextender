# OnePlus Parallel Apps Extender

This module allows you to add any app (but not System apps) to the list of the supported applications by the "Parallel Apps" feature of *OnePlus* phones with OxygenOS.
The module is compatible with **Android 9, 10 and 11**, it has been tested on the following devices: 

* OnePlus 5
* OnePlus 5T
* OnePlus 7 Pro
* OnePlus 7T
* OnePlus 8 Pro
  
but it should also work on other OnePlus models.

# How to use it:

1. Install the module
2. Open the app and select the app(s) you want to add to the list
3. Check the Parallel Apps list*

*Sometimes it may be necessary to force close the Settings app or restart the phone.

The apps that have been cloned will remain active even if the module is disabled!

The module can also be installed on a OnePlus with Android 8/8.1 (Oreo) but the correct operation is not guaranteed, If you try it on this version and it works properly let me know! Or if there are problems and you want to help me solve them contact me privately on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alex193a) or [Telegram](https://t.me/alex193a).

Also let me know if the module works on another OnePlus model besides the ones mentioned above :-)
